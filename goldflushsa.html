        For precise downhole filter cake removal and elimination of wellbore
          damage from oil base and synthetic oil base drilling fluid losses,
          the recommended amounts of <strong>DSC Gold Flush SA</strong> will vary from each wellbore.
          These are some of the factors that have a significant effect upon the
          cleaning process (and tend to accelerate cleaning when using <strong>DSC
          Gold Flush SA</strong>): downhole temperature (heat), aggressive chemicals (<strong>DSC
          Gold Flush SA</strong>), contact time and mechanical cleaning (annular velocity and
          agitation).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Futura Lt BT, Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">For the highest level of critical cleaning only neat solutions should
          be used to avoid any potential for cross contamination and solvent
          saturation.</font></p>
