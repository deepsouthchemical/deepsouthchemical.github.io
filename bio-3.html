              <strong>Outstanding Characteristics:</strong><br>
              <strong>BIO 3</strong> is a water soluble corrosion inhibitor bactericide and oxygen scavenger
  designed for use as a packer fluid additive. It is a blend of high molecular
  weight filming amines, aqueous bisulfite solution and thiocarbonate solution.
              <strong>BIO 3</strong> performs as a corrosion inhibitor by preferentially adsorbing a thin
  molecular film on all metal surfaces, thereby stifling the corrosion process.</font></p>

              <strong>Description:</strong><br>
              <strong>BIO 3</strong> is and all purpose corrosion inhibitor designed for packer fluids, kill
  water, workover fluids, and pads prior to cementing. It is a liquid, multifunctional
  chemical that is effective against oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide
  corrosion. <strong>BIO 3</strong> is water soluble at high brine concentrations.</font></p>
        <hr>        <p><font face="Futura Lt BT, Arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <strong>Application:</strong> <br>
  The recommended treatment for <strong>BIO 3</strong> is 55 gallons per 150-200 barrels of fluid.
  This dosage can vary depending on the type of fluid as well as depth and time
  which <strong>BIO 3</strong> will be exposed for protection.</font></p>
        <hr>        <p><font face="Futura Lt BT, Arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>
  Handling and Storage:</strong><br>
  Normal storage and handling as with any industrial chemical should be observed.
  In case of spills or contact with skin, eyes, or clothing, wash with plenty
  of water. Since emptied packages retain product residue, follow label warnings
  even after package is emptied. <strong>BIO 3</strong> is available in 55 gallon, non-returnable,
  lined steel drums, and 5 gallon cans. </font></p>
