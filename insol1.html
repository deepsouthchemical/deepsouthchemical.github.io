            InSol asphaltene/wax inhibitor/solvent is cutting-edge technology for
            the prevention and treatment of organic deposition problems in the formation
            and surface and subsurface facilities. Its development incorporates scientific
            know-how accumulated over the last 100 years. Recent advances in the
            prevention and treatment of asphaltene and wax problems have guided InSol's
            development and formulation. We predict that one day all asphaltene and
            wax problems will be solved using the InSol technology. What is the reason
          for this claim?        </p>
      </div>
        <p>InSol is a superb product synthesized from tested ingredients that
          are friendly to most (if not all) formations. No adverse reactions
          are known between InSol and formation minerals. InSol treatments should
          not adversely influence the wettability of rock already plugged with
          asphaltenes and paraffins. InSol is a combination of a powerful asphaltene/wax
          inhibitor and a powerful asphaltene/wax solvent. The scientifically
          blended surfactants in InSol help break up the strong bonds of the
          asphaltene and wax particles with the formation minerals and carry
          them with the rest of the oil to the surface. Tests have shown that,
          on a per pound basis, InSol is the most cost-effective and most powerful
          product on the market. There are currently four InSol asphaltene/ wax
          products: InSol A, InSol W, InSol A/W, and InSol WPPD.</p>

        <p><font color="#FF0000" size="+2">Treatments</font><br>
          <font color="#FF00FF" size="+1">Formation Damage</font><br>
          Properly designed InSol squeeze treatments can be used to remove existing
          organic scale from the near-wellbore formation. Similar squeeze treatments
          may be used for inhibition purposes to prolong the time between remedial
          treatments. In offshore and remote Arctic operations eliminating one
          or two squeeze remedial treatments per year by replacing an chemical
          like xylene with the more effective InSol translates into considerable
        savings for the operator.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF00FF" size="+1">Tubings and Flowlines</font><br>
          InSol may be used both as inhibitor and as remedial solvent/surfactant.
            Proper tests need to be made to determine whether it is preferable
        to inhibit or remedy an organic deposition problem.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF00FF" size="+1">Production Facilities</font><br>
          InSol injection in the tubing and flowlines will most likely protect
        the production facilities from organic deposition.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF00FF" size="+1">Storage Facilities</font><br>
          A portion of the re-suspended organic particles is expected to settle
            again in the storage facilities. Periodic batch treatments of the
            storage facilities with InSol can be designed to eliminate the accumulation
        of organic particles.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF00FF" size="+1">Manufacturer</font><br>
          InSol is manufactured by Kosta Oil Field Technologies. Inc., an emerging
            company backed by talented professionals who have unparalleled state-of-the-art
            know-how in the area of asphaltenes, waxes, and well-bore related
            treatments. Currently, the company has distributors worldwide. The
            headquarters of Kosta Oil Field Technologies is in Stafford (a suburb
            of Houston), Texas. <br>
