                <strong>Description:</strong><br>
            The removal of Barium Sulfate scale by chemical means has in
                the past met with only very limited success despite the numerous
                chemicals
              tried. At the present time it is taken for granted that no chemical
              claiming to have such &#8220;powers&#8221; is naturally regarded
              with a great deal of skepticism. <strong>DSC BaSOL</strong> removes scale by a process
              of chelation. Powerful chelating agents and surfactants are selected
              for this formulation to remove scale in different environments. There
              are many parameters which affect the rate of dissolution of a solid.
              An attempt has been made to list each of these parameters and then
              systematically addresses each one in order to quantify the relative
              affect and help design an optimum treatment regime for chemical removal
              of scale in the field. The following parameters play a predominant
              role in scale removal:</font></p>          <p><font face="Futura Lt BT, Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">(a)	MINERALOGY<br>
              (b)	TEMPERATURE<br>

              (d)	STOICHIOMETRY<br>
              (e)	AGITATION<br>

          <p>            <strong>Application:<br>
  DSC BaSO</strong>L has been designed to give optimum pH conditions for dissolution
            of Barium Sulfate scale.<strong> DSC BaSOL</strong> has a strong buffering action
            but if it is anticipated that contact with fluids will significantly
            alter the alkalinity of the chemical the treatment can be designed
            to minimize any possible deleterious effect on the efficiency of
            scale dissolution. <strong>DSC BaSOL</strong> can be diluted to suit the application.
            At dilution ratio of 1:1 with water, <strong>DSC BaSOL</strong> can dissolve scale
            in a range of 22-30 g./l. The physical state of scale plays a predominant
        role in dissolution rate.</p>
