            <strong>Description:<br>
    DSC VIS</strong> is a modified non-ionic natural polymer composed of pure hydroxyethyl
    cellulose (HEC).</font></p>
        <hr>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        <p><br>
            <strong>Application:<br>
  DSC VIS</strong> can be utilized to viscosify fresh and brine waters such as
  sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium bromide and calcium chloride. <strong>DSC
  VIS</strong> has all the viscosity building properties of natural gums and
  guars, but is not adversely affected by bacteria, polar compounds, divalent
  metal ions (i.e. Ca+2) or cement. With good mixing equipment, this product
  usually can be used to build high viscosities in low density brine waters.
  However, with poor mixing equipment, or poor agitation, there is the possibility
  of developing &#8220;fisheyes&#8221; (polymer that has not been completely
  wet and forms a ball or eye-shaped solid. This solid mass will not mix and
  is potentially damaging to the formation). If high densities are mandated or
  if the need for elevated viscosity is needed in higher density brines then <strong>DSC
  HEC LINEAR GEL</strong>, which is liquid HEC, should be used. Each HEC granule
  has been prewet with a hydrocarbon allowing the product to lose this coating
  slowly and assume the proper wetting rate, eliminating the possibility of fisheyes.</p>
        </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        <p>Like DSC HEC LINEAR GEL,<strong> DSC VIS</strong> is also acid soluble,
          enzyme degradable. A wide variety of breakers are also available. <strong>DSC
          VIS</strong> begin to thermally
          degrade at approximately 200&deg;F. As with DSC HEC LINEAR GEL, this
          product can be stabilized to maximum temperature of 300&deg;F with varying
          concentrations
          of DSC EXTENDER-75. </p>
        <p>Recommended treatment is .5 to 3 lbs. per barrel</p>
