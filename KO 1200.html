            <strong>Description:<br>
            KO 1200</strong> is a liquid, water soluble zinc chelate designed to scavenger
          H2S in most brine and fresh water drilling fluid systems. It also provides
          some degree of protection against corrosion resulting from oxygen.
          Being a liquid, it can be injected directly into the mud pump suction
          line with a chemical pump, thus avoiding costly and messy mixing of
          powders. </font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><font face="Futura Lt BT, Arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>KO 1200</strong> is compatible with all brine and fresh water polymer systems,
            all brine and fresh systems free of solids, brine water clay and starch
            systems, and weighted systems where additional dispersion is not a
            problem.</font></p>

        <font face="Futura Lt BT, Arial, helvetica, sans-serif">      <br>
        <strong>Application:</strong><br>
        Drilling fluids should be pretreated with <strong>KO 1200</strong> prior to drilling
          a formation suspected of containing hydrogen sulfide. One 55 gallon
          drum per thousand barrels of drilling fluid is recommended initially
          to scavenge up to 50-80 PPM soluble sulfide. Moderate H2S intrusions
          can be controlled by a daily continuos treatment of 7-12 gallons of
          <strong>KO 1200</strong> through a chemical pump at the mud pump suction. Treatment
          of higher-volume intrusions require the injection of correspondingly
          larger quantities of <strong>KO 1200.</strong><br>
